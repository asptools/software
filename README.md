This is a meta-level repository for gathering software related to ASPTOOLS under one roof. In general, the collection provides an approach to *translation-based* Answer Set Programming (ASP) which deploys ASP for knowledge representation but enables the use of different kinds of solvers for the search of answer sets. Besides this overall purpose, the collection includes also other utilities, see individual repositories for comments. 

For the moment, the ASPTOOLS collection builds on the following publicly available repositories:

1. *asplib*
2. *asptools*
3. *asptranslate*

Some utilities have been previously published as binaries under the respective
[Aalto website](https://research.ics.aalto.fi/software/asp/) but they are
gradually moving under this project. The collection partly consists of legacy
research software, made public in hope being useful for future research, but
also some new utilities will be added.

The following repositories are included as submodules:

1. *sgb*
2. *kissat*
3. *wasp*
