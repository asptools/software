Compiling: Just run the "build" script. This version of h++ and h++/ce
depends on the CPLEX headers and libraries. It has been developed and
tested with CPLEX version 12.5. Paths to the CPLEX headers and (static)
libraries, appropriate for the IPC 2014 development environment, are
hard-coded in the build script; you may have to change them to make it
build on a different system.

Running: The "plan" script follows the IPC standard:

 plan <domain file> <problem file> <solution file>

The solution file is created by redirecting stdout. This means the
planners will generate an invalid (empty, except for comments) solution
file if no plan is found.
